OpenAPI 3.0 is a specification for building APIs that can help streamline the development process, making it more efficient and less error-prone. When designing APIs with OpenAPI 3.0, here are some standard guidelines you might find helpful:

1. Design First: Start with the design of your API before jumping into the implementation. This "contract-first" approach helps ensure that the API is designed appropriately and consistently from the beginning.

2. Use Clear, Consistent Naming: When defining endpoints and parameters, use clear, concise naming. Stick to a consistent naming convention across your API. For example, RESTful APIs usually use plural nouns for the endpoint names (like /users instead of /user).

3. Use HTTP Methods Appropriately: HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.) have specific meanings in the context of a RESTful API. For instance, GET is used to retrieve a resource, POST to create a new one, PUT to update a resource, and DELETE to remove one.

4. HTTP Status Codes: Use HTTP status codes to communicate the result of an API request. Successful operations, for example, should return 200 (OK), 201 (Created), or 204 (No Content).

5. Error Handling: Provide meaningful error messages. Include an error code, a message, and possibly a detailed description or a link to more info.

6. Pagination, Filtering, and Sorting: These are essential features for APIs that expose large amounts of data. Consider how clients will navigate your data.

7. Versioning: Changes to the API can break clients. To avoid this, use versioning.

8. Security: Use appropriate security measures, like authentication and authorization. OAuth2 and OpenID Connect are common choices.

9. Include Descriptions: OpenAPI 3.0 supports the inclusion of descriptive text in the API definition. Use it to add details like the purpose of an endpoint or how to use parameters.

10. Use Schemas Appropriately: The components/schemas section of an OpenAPI document allows you to define the data structures used by your API. Leverage these definitions to ensure consistency and reusability.

11. Validation: OpenAPI allows for rich validation rules. For example, you can specify a parameter as being a string, a valid email, and that it should appear once and only once.

12. Remember, a well-designed API with clear and accurate documentation can significantly improve the developer experience, so investing time in good API design is often well worth the effort.
